## Usage

### Pieces Picker

The `dac-pieces-picker` script shows you all combinations of the pieces depending on their species and classes.

![Pieces Picker](dac_picker/images/readme/pieces-picker-window.png)

Start the `dac-pieces-picker` script and click on the piece icon. The green color highlights all pieces of the same species. If the piece has second species, then corresponding pieces are highlighted by the yellow color. Blue color highlights the pieces with the same class. Purple color matches the pieces with the same species and class.

You will see a brief description of the piece's skill near the red box.

Stars under each piece icon show its cost.

### Items Picker

The `dac-items-picker` script shows you combinations of items.

![Items Picker](dac_picker/images/readme/items-picker-window.png)

Start the `dac-items-picker` script and click on the item icon. The red color highlights the selected item. You will see a description of this item at the bottom of the window. If the item can be combined in the upgrade, it is marked by the blue color. The green color highlights all components (if they exist) of the selected item. If the upgrade consists of two similar items, the corresponding item icon is highlighted by the yellow color.

Let us consider the screenshot above. The select item is Maelstorm. You can combine it with Hyperstone for getting Mjollnir. So, Mjollnir is marked by a blue color. You can get Maelstorm by the combination of Javelin and Mithril Hammer. Thus, these two items are highlighted by the green color.

Stars under each item icon show its tier. The `U` letter means that this is an upgraded item.

### Combo Picker

The `dac-combo-picker` script shows you strong combinations of pieces for each phase of the game. Using these combinations you can build your own strategy. This script is recommended for advanced players.

![Combo Picker](dac_picker/images/readme/combo-picker-window.png)

You see three tabs when starting the script: "Earlygame", "Midgame" and "Lategame". On each tab, there are lines with recommended combos. There are three columns: name of the combo, the preferred line for pieces in this combo ("Front", "Back", "Mixed") and icons of pieces in this combo.

When you buy pieces of the specific combo you can press on corresponding icons. Then these pieces will be highlighted by the red color in all combos on all tabs. So, you can continue building your strategy considering the pieces which you already bought.

Also, the green color highlights all pieces with the same species as pieces which you already bought. The same way, blue color highlights all pieces with the same classes.

The combos are defined in the `combos.csv` database file.

This is the path to this file on Linux:<br/>
`~/.local/share/dac_picker/combos.csv`

This is the path to this file on Windows:<br/>
`C:\User\<username>\AppData\Local\dac_picker\combos.csv`

These are steps to add a new combo:

1. Open the CSV document. You can open this file in any text editor or MS/Libre Office application.
2. Add priority of your combo in the first column.
3. Add game phase of the combo in the second column.
4. Add the name of combo in the third column.
5. Add comma separated pieces of your combo in the fourth column. Use pieces names from the `pieces.csv` database file.
6. Save the modified `combos.csv` file.

Now the `dac-combo-picker` script shows your combo.
